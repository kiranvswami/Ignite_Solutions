**Gutenburg Project

1. Multibrowser.py

Steps:
  I have used the pycharm for code writing and imported the Selenium Webdriver.
  The main objective of this code is to check the multibrowser functonality.
  I have downloaded the chrome and IE browsers drivers and provided their respective executable paths in the code.
  After that added the project url in the code.
  Run this code by commenting the one browser at a time.
 
Output:
  We will see that given projec url is successfully redirected in the Crome and IE browser.
